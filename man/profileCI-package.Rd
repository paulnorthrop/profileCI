\title{profileCI: Profiling a Log-Likelihood to Calculate Confidence Intervals}
\description{
Provides tools for profiling a user-supplied log-likelihood function to
calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. Speed of computation
can be improved by adjusting the step sizes in the profiling and/or starting
the profiling from limits based on the approximate large sample normal
distribution for the maximum likelihood estimator of a parameter. The
accuracy of the limits can be set by the user. A plot method visualises the
log-likelihood and confidence interval. Only convex log-likelihoods are
supported, that is, disjoint confidence intervals will not be found.
}
\details{
The main function is \code{\link{profileCI}}, which profiles the
log-likelihood, with respect to one parameter at a time.
