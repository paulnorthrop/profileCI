# profileCI 1.1.0

## New features

* The argument `optim_args` actually works now! Thank you to Jakob Madsen (#1).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Arguments to the user-supplied log-likelihood function are extracted explicitly to simplify the code and avoid potential argument matching issues.
