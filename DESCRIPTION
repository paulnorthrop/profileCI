Description: Provides tools for profiling a user-supplied log-likelihood 
    function to calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. Speed of 
    computation can be improved by adjusting the step sizes in the profiling 
    and/or starting the profiling from limits based on the approximate large 
    sample normal distribution for the maximum likelihood estimator of a 
    parameter. The accuracy of the limits can be set by the user. A plot method 
    visualises the log-likelihood and confidence interval. Cases where the 
    profile log-likelihood flattens above the value at which a confidence limit
    is defined can be handled, leading to a limit at plus or minus infinity.
    Disjoint confidence intervals will not be found.
