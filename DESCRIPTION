Description: Provides tools for profiling a user-supplied log-likelihood 
    function to calculate confidence intervals for model parameters. Speed of 
    computation can be improved by adjusting the step sizes in the profiling 
    and/or starting the profiling from limits based on the approximate large 
    sample normal distribution for the maximum likelihood estimator of a 
    parameter. The accuracy of the limits can be set by the user. A plot method 
    visualises the log-likelihood and confidence interval. Only convex 
    log-likelihoods are supported, that is, disjoint confidence intervals will 
    not be found.
